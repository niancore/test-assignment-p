Complexity estimation

The chosen solution takes linear time, as it takes one iteration through the given list of values to insert the elements into the dictionary and check, if a current element is already in the dictionary. Time complexity: O(n).

The maximum extra space required equals the number of the list elements. Space complexity: O(n).
